Don't send a lot of small messages right after each other. Do not disrupt chat by spamming.<br><br>

4. No pornographic/adult/other NSFW material<br>
This is a community server and not meant to share this kind of material.<br><br>

5. No advertisements<br>
We do not tolerate any kind of advertisements, whether it be for other communities or streams. You can post your content in the media channel if it is relevant and provides actual value (Video/Art)<br><br>

9. Follow the Discord Community Guidelines<br>
You can find them here: https://discordapp.com/guidelines<br><br>
 
10. Do not join voice chat channels without permission of the people already in there<br>
If you see that they have a free spot it is alright to join and ask whether they have an open spot, but leave if your presence is not wanted by whoever was there first.<br><br>

The Managers and Mods will Mute/Kick/Ban per discretion. If you feel mistreated dm an Admin and we will resolve the issue.<br><br>

All Channels will have pinned messages explaining what they are there for and how everything works. If you don't understand something, feel free to ask!<br><br>

Your presence in this server implies accepting these rules, including all further changes. These changes might be done at any time without notice, it is your responsibility to check for them.<br><br>
